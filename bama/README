You probably need C++17 for this.


- We use Just(..) and Nothing() to have the operators decide at
  compile time what the outputs are. Nothing() means we want to skip
  that result and Just(filepath) means we want the result to be
  generated.

- mkOperation functions are wrapping the constructors because c++
  typesystem can only infer the Maybes in function templates, not in
  class templates.

- All operation classes support the .run() method. We do it this way
  rather than having them for historical reasons (the whole thing is
  based on bama, that's also where the namespaces come from).
